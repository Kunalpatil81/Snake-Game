# Snake Game

Simple browser-based Snake game built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

-   `index.html` — game canvas and layout.
-   `script.js` — game logic (movement, food, collisions, score).
-   `style.css` — styling for the page and game area.

## How to Run

1. Open the `snake-game` folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open With).

No build tools or server required.

## Controls

-   Arrow keys (`←` `→` `↑` `↓`) to move the snake.

## Gameplay

-   Eat food to grow and increase your score.
-   Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Customization

-   Change speed: edit the game loop interval in `script.js`.
-   Change grid size: edit the canvas sizing or grid variables in `script.js` and `style.css`.

## Development Notes

-   The main game loop, input handling, and collision detection are in `script.js`.
-   Styles are simple and live in `style.css` — feel free to add Tailwind or other frameworks.

## Troubleshooting

-   If the game doesn't start, open the browser console (F12) and check for errors in `script.js`.

## Credits

This is a small practice project. Inspired by classic Snake implementations.

If you'd like, I can:

-   Add gameplay instructions inside the game UI.
-   Add a `High Scores` feature using `localStorage`.
-   Create a `README` in the repo root describing all mini-projects.

Let me know which you'd prefer.
